In scheduling, start_time and end_time should both be after whatever time it is right now. 
Add functionality to get_all_l2vpns to accept a broader iso8601 or take a (1) for all archived objects.
Double check that create_l2vpns will give an error if the name and endpoints attributes are not correct. 
Unittests are probably not executing properly, check the ones that exist and correct them and then create unittests for the remaining methods.
Read over sdx_client and check docstrings and see if any support functions can be removed to another file. 
Create the README.
Is this on MIT license?
Is it okay that the empty SDXClient object be created initially or would you prefer the obeject be created with a base url already specified?
Check that docstrings are following same format (Args, Returns, Raises).
Check that all methods have docstrings.
Unit tests for SDXExceptions edge cases. 
Look at logging and maybe consider adding additional logging. 
Extract attribute validation to separate modules and methods. 
There's some repetition in the methods dealing with API requests. Consider creating a helper method to handle common request logic (e.g., setting up headers, handling responses, caching).
Use type hints for method arguments and return types to improve code readability and support for static analysis tools.
Look in to `mypy` to ensure type safety across codebase.
Ensure logging is consistent and at appropriate levels (info, debug, error). This will help in monitoring and debugging when running client in production.
Configure logger with a specific format and potentially output to files or other logging services.
test_client_endpoints.py: test_create_l2vpn_endpoints_required: Endpoints, name, and url attributes need to be required in the create_l2vpn method but only URL needs to be required in the other methods.
